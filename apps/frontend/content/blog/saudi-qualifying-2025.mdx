## Verstappen's Flying Lap Secures Pole in Jeddah

The Saudi Arabian Grand Prix qualifying session delivered high-stakes drama and razor-thin margins as **Max Verstappen** snatched **pole position** with a jaw-dropping lap.

Under the lights of the rapid-fire **Jeddah Corniche Circuit**, Verstappen reminded the world why he's the reigning world champion. The Red Bull driver nailed a near-perfect **1:27.294**, edging out McLaren's Oscar Piastri by just **0.010 seconds**.

With Jeddah's high-speed, wall-lined layout offering no room for error, Verstappen’s precision and aggression were on full display — just enough to secure his third pole of the 2025 season.

## Lando Norris Hits the Wall After Dominating Q2

The shock of the session came in Q3, where **championship leader Lando Norris** — after topping both FP3 and Q2 — crashed out in dramatic fashion.

His McLaren made heavy contact with the wall midway through his final push lap, bringing out the red flag and abruptly ending his qualifying charge. Norris will start the race from **P10**, visibly frustrated, knowing he had the pace to challenge for pole.

> _“Gutted. It was mine to lose — and I did.”_ — Norris to Sky Sports

## Russell on Row 2, Leclerc and Antonelli Close Behind

Mercedes’ **George Russell** will start **P3** after a tidy final lap, followed by **Charles Leclerc (P4)** for Ferrari and impressive rookie **Kimi Antonelli (P5)** — continuing to impress in his debut season.

### Remaining Top Ten:

- **Carlos Sainz** (Williams) – P6  
- **Lewis Hamilton** (Ferrari) – P7  
- **Yuki Tsunoda** (Red Bull) – P8  
- **Pierre Gasly** (Alpine) – P9  
- **Lando Norris** (McLaren) – P10  

Notably, **Fernando Alonso** and **Lance Stroll** failed to make Q3 during **Aston Martin’s 100th Grand Prix appearance** — a disappointing milestone.
